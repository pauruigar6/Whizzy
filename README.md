- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Run and Test

- **Android**
```bash
npx expo start --android
```
Use an Android Studio emulator or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app.
- **iOS**
```bash
npx expo start --ios
```
Use an Xcode simulator or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app for iOS.

- **Web**
```bash
npx expo start --web
```
This will open the web version of the app in your browser.

## Build and Download

- **Create build for Android (APK or AAB)**
```bash
npx eas build -p android
```

- **Crear build para iOS**
```bash
npx eas build -p ios
```
Note: iOS builds require an Apple Developer account.

- **Descargar la app**
Download the app After building with EAS Build, Expo will provide a link to download the .apk, .aab, or iOS file. Check the official documentation for more details.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
